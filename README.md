This is just a place for me to keep small projects that I enjoying messing with.<br>
RPSLS.py	Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game as described by TBBT's Sheldon.<br>
Stock-price.py	Presents some interesting data on a few stocks I'm interested in.  Very rough.<br>
hangman.py  Pulls the Word of the Day from m-w.com and then plays hangman.  Kind of fun to start the day.<br>
